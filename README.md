# A-googleNet-Inception-V2-classifier
in this project i use the deprecated Inceptionv2 to build a classifier, the classifier uses a categorical entropty to classify only two items. this shows how the categorical entropy can both be used for binary classification and also multi-class classification


to use my code, create a data folder on root directly and insert your custom dataset
after training, a model.h5 file will be created inclufing a training_history.csv files
